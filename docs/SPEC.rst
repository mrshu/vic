ViC
===

Name
----

The name is derived from `ViCo` which was the name of this project previously.
Trouble is that there is another `very interesting project
<http://www.vicoapp.com/>`_ with this name so the decision has been made and
the name was changed.

Purpose
-------

ViC is primarily aimed at the Arduino environment. Its intended use is to
help with debugging/controlling programms running on the Arduino platform
by providing a simple shell-like environment. Moreover its design should
ensure that it can provide RPC-like functionality.

Design principles
-----------------

ViC is supposed to run on in embedded systems settings so the first and
foremost design principle is to choose effective solutions while providing
as much comfort to the user as possible. This tradeoff is very difficult
one to make and it is also what makes designing a system like ViC very
difficult. It also means that this document will be a subject to frequent
edits.
