ViC
===

Name
----

The name is derived from `ViCo` which was the name of this project previously.
Trouble is that there is another `very interesting project
<http://www.vicoapp.com/>`_ with this name so the decision has been made and 
the name was changed. 

Purpose
-------

ViC is primarily aimed at the Arduino environment. Its intended use is to
help with debugging/controlling programms running on the Arduino platform
by providing a simple shell-like environment. Moreover its design should
ensure that it can provide RPC-like functionality.
